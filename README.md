# Weather-Forecast Project.
This project was solely focused on building a simple weather forecast application that displays forecast for any city for the present day and the next 5 days. 
API from openweather.org was used to get the statistics that are displayed on the application. On the search bar once you enter the name of a city and hit the 
search button, it will give you the details about weather on the same page. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, and AjAX were the applications and technique used to 
build this project.

I am currently making some changes to this project. The final version will be available soon.
